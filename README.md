# Getting Started

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### Build APK (Android)

From the project root, run:

```sh
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The generated APK will be located at:

```sh
android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```
